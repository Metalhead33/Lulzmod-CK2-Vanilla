# LulzMod CK2 Vanilla

The original LulzMod for Crusader Kings II. Deprecated in favour of its [Crusader Kings III-based successor](https://git.sonck.nl/metalhead/paradox-mods/lulzmod-ck3), it won't be updated anymore.

Incompatible with any total conversion mods, or any mods that alter the map and delete vanilla titles. Otherwise should be compatible with every mod.
